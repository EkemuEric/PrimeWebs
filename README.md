PrimeWebs a personal portfolio website that shows all my recent developments in the world of programming more so in the field of web development.
It uses basic html, css, and javascript.
My code is always under development to make the website have better User Interface and User Experience.So, learning a thing or two from fellow developers wouldn't hurt.
